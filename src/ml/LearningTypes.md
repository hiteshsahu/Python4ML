#### Supervised learning
  - Test Data have lables
  - We are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
  - Eg. Cancer detection based on Cancer data base

 1. **Regression**: predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. 

 2. **Classification** we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, 
we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories eg true false.

#### Unsupervised learning
 - Test Data have no labels.
 - Automatically find Cluster, group & Pattern in input data
 
  **Clustering Algoritham:** Group customer in market segment, group friends in FB, group news.
  **Cocktail Party Algorithm:** Seperation of voice from music
