## ML Types


#### Supervised learning
 We are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like,
having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

 1. **Regression **: predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. 

 2. *Classification* , we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, 
we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories eg true false.

#### Unsupervised learning
